**Introduction**

This project is a simple license plate recognition demonstration that mostly employs the template matching method. It should be noted that some templates are not generated using images taken by myself, but rather with pictures discovered on the Internet, resulting in improper matching of certain numbers and abbreviations owing to factors such as time.
